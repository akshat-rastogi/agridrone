      <h1>Agri-Drone Policies</h1>
      <h2>PTO (Paid Time Off) Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All full-time employees receive <strong>20 paid days off</strong> per
          year.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sick days are flexible—take them as needed, no doctor's note required.
        </li>
        <li>National holidays are observed based on your location.</li>
        <li>
          No approval bottlenecks: simply block your time on the shared calendar
          and notify your manager.
        </li>
        <li>
          We encourage everyone to take at least 5 consecutive days off annually
          to recharge.
        </li>
